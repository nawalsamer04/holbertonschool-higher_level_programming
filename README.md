# RESTful API – Task 0: Basics of HTTP/HTTPS

## Difference between HTTP and HTTPS
HTTP transfers data in plain text, meaning intercepted data can be read.
HTTPS adds a security layer using SSL/TLS encryption, protecting data confidentiality, integrity, and server authenticity.

## Structure of an HTTP Request and Response

### HTTP Request
- Method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Path (endpoint)
- Headers (metadata)
- Body (optional)

### HTTP Response
- Status code (e.g., 200, 404)
- Headers
- Body (returned data)

## Common HTTP Methods
- GET: Retrieve data from the server
- POST: Create a new resource
- PUT: Update an existing resource
- DELETE: Remove a resource

## Common HTTP Status Codes
- 200 OK: Request successful
- 201 Created: Resource successfully created
- 400 Bad Request: Invalid request
- 404 Not Found: Resource not found
- 500 Internal Server Error: Server error occurred
